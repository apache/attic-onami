      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Apache Onami</span> is a project focused on the development and
      maintenance of a set of Google Guice extensions not provided out of the box by the library itself nor the
      Google developers team, such as integration with 3rd part frameworks or extra functionalities.</p>

      <p>The name takes inspiration from <a href="http://www.101zenstories.com/index.php?story=8">Great Waves</a>
      (<i>O-nami</i>, in Japanese) Zen story.</p>

    <section name="Disclaimer" class="alert">
      <p>Apache Onami is an effort undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at
      The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly
      accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
      process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
      it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
      <p>You can view our current <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/amber.html">incubation status</a>
      for more details.</p>
