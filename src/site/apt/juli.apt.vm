JULI - Java Utils Logging

  Users that want to use the <<<java.util.logging>>> package and let <Guice>
  injects automagically <<<java.util.logging.Logger>>> instances, have to add
  the following dependency in the <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--------------------------------------+
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.onami.logging</groupId>
  <artifactId>onami-logging-juli</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
+--------------------------------------+

  then, when creating the <<<com.google.inject.Injector>>>, add the
  <<<org.nnsoft.guice.sli4j.juli.JuliLoggingModule>>> module; please take note
  that users have to specify the classes <<<com.google.inject.matcher.Matcher>>>
  for whom the logging injection has to be applied:

+--------------------------------------+
import com.google.inject.Guice;
import com.google.inject.Injector;

import org.apache.onami.logging.juli.JuliLoggingModule;
import com.google.inject.matcher.Matchers;

...

Injector injector = Guice.createInjector( new JuliLoggingModule( Matchers.any() ),
    ...
);
+--------------------------------------+

  and the magic happens :)
