JSR330 integration

  <Apache Onami-Test> provides a nice integration with <JSR330> dependency injection for Java.
  By using <<<javax.inject.Inject>>> <OnamiRunner> will provide to inject the dependency inside your test case.

  Here is a little example:
  

+----------------------------------------+
@RunWith( OnamiRunner.class )
public class InjectJSR330ModuleClassTestCase
    extends AbstractModule
{

    public void configure()
    {
        bind( Integer.class ).annotatedWith( Names.named( "numeber.version" ) ).toInstance( 10 );
    }

    @javax.inject.Inject
    @javax.inject.Named( "numeber.version" )
    private Integer version;

	...

}
