      <p>
        Apache Onami uses shared <a href="/mail-lists.html">mailing lists</a> for all
        of itcomponents.
        To make it easier for people to only read messages related to components they are interested in,
        the convention in Onami is to prefix the subject line of messages with the component's name,
        for example:
        <ul>
          <li>[configuration] ConcurrentModificationException when running tests in parallel</li>
          <li>[autobind] ModuleBindingFeature doesn't keep trace of bound jobs</li>
          <li>[scheduler] Optionally support repeated scheduling of the same job / trigger tuple</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Questions related to the usage of Commons components should be posted to the
        User List.
        <br />
        The Developer List
        is for questions and discussion related to the development of components.
        <br />
        Please do not cross-post; developers are also subscribed to the user list.
        Read the archives first in case your question has already been answered.
        If not, then subscribe to the appropriate list and post your question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> please don't send patches or attachments to any of the mailing lists.
        Patches are best handled via the <i>Issue Tracking</i> system. 
        Otherwise, please upload the file to a public server and include the URL in the mail.
