Welcome to ${project.name}!

  ${project.name} is a small java library for <JUnit> that minimizes the boilerplate code
  in your unit test relying on <Google Guice> to inject directly into your test
  cases all the required dependecies.
  Moreover it makes easier creating and injecting Mock and Stubs for your test
  cases and inject them into your  bussiness-logic classes.

Before Coding...
